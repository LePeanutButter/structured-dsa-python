# Algorithms and Data Structures Collection (Jan – May 2024)

This repository contains a collection of labs developed between January and May 2024 as part of a course on Data Structures and Algorithms, using Python.


## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects demonstrating fundamental algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. The repository is organized into the following folders, each focusing on a specific area:

- **binary-tree-reconstruction**  
  *Purpose:* Reconstruct binary trees from traversal orders (pre-order and in-order) and output the post-order traversal.  
  *Key Concepts:* Tree traversal, recursion, and binary tree construction.

- **dijkstra-heap-optimization**  
  *Purpose:* Optimize Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph using a binary heap and HeapSort techniques (both min-heap and max-heap variants).  
  *Key Concepts:* Graph theory, priority queues, heap optimization, and shortest path algorithms.

- **double-linkedlist**  
  *Purpose:* Implement a double-linked list to manage collections of data (such as a LIFO stack for Book objects), demonstrating dynamic memory manipulation and efficient insertion/deletion operations.  
  *Key Concepts:* Linked lists, LIFO stacks, object-oriented programming, and dynamic data structures.

- **graph-search-algorithms**  
  *Purpose:* Implement classic graph search methods—Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)—on graphs constructed from practical problems (e.g., maze/labyrinth solving).  
  *Key Concepts:* Graph representations (adjacency matrix and list), graph traversals, and real-world search problems.

- **hash-table-collision-resolution**  
  *Purpose:* Address collision handling in hash tables by implementing strategies (such as chaining) that allow efficient insertion, deletion, and searching in a hash-based data structure.  
  *Key Concepts:* Hashing, collision resolution, and data retrieval efficiency.

- **recursive-algorithms**  
  *Purpose:* Showcase a suite of recursive solutions to common computational problems, including sorting arrays, summing subarrays, computing the greatest common divisor, converting integers to binary, and reversing lists.  
  *Key Concepts:* Recursion, divide-and-conquer strategies, mathematical recurrences, and algorithm design.

## How to Use
Each folder is self-contained with its own README file that details its purpose, input/output requirements, and sample test cases. To run any of the projects:
1. Navigate to the folder of interest.
2. Follow the specific instructions provided in that folder’s README file.
3. Run the corresponding Python file using:
   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```
